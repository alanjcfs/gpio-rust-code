= GPIO Rust Code

In the shell, you can run the following

    # echo 23 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    # echo out > /sys/class/gpio23/direction
    # echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/value

This tells the system to get GPIO 23 ready for output and outputs the value 1,
which turns it on.

== Is it any good?

No.
